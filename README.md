## Overview

LJFerrand.com (1.0) is a custom WordPress theme built from the underscores (_s) theme starter. 

The site features Custom Post Types for the projects which are set up using Advanced Custom Fields so I can quickly add new portfolio pieces to my site with ease and consistency.

## Summary

### Key Takeaways

WordPress is a powerful open-source CMS with so much potential for customization. Now that I have site built and have exposed the ACF REST endpoints, I plan on decoupling the site, which will give me more flexibility to develop front end, while retaining the functionality of the WordPress backend for site administration. 

### Roadmap

I have some upcoming plans for this site including:

 - [ ] Decoupled build with Frontity, pulling data via the WordPress REST API
 - [ ] Logo animation with Three.js
